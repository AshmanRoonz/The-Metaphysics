Copyright (c) 2025 Ashman Roonz (ashmanroonz.ca)

Preamble
This license is built on one norm: steelman first, receipts always.
If you distribute or deploy this Work, you must keep attribution, publish
basic "receipts" (what changed, with what evidence), and avoid
misrepresenting the Work or its results. Everything else is permissive.

0. Definitions
"Work" means the source, binaries, models, data, documentation, or artwork
released under this license.
"You" means the licensee.
"Distribute" means provide copies to a third party.
"Deploy" means make the Work or a Modified Work available as a service or
in a product (including over a network).
"Modified Work" means any work that contains, is derived from, or bundles
the Work.
"Receipts" means a plain-text/markdown file that lists: (a) what you
changed, (b) evidence or tests you ran and where to find them, (c)
version/date and contact, (d) how to roll back or revert your changes.

1. Grant of Rights
Subject to the Conditions below, You are granted a worldwide, royalty-free,
nonexclusive, irrevocable license to use, copy, modify, distribute, and
deploy the Work, in whole or in part, for any purpose.
This grant includes the right to make, have made, and sell products or
services embodying the Work, and a non-assert covenant from each contributor
covering their contributor-owned patents necessarily infringed by their
contributions as submitted to the upstream project.

2. Conditions (inclusion, keep attribution, publish receipts, be clear)
2.01 Right to Participate. Ashman Roonz retains the right to participate 
in any project or derivative work that utilizes this source. Use of the 
source constitutes acknowledgment of this right, and timely invitation to 
participate satisfies Interface integrity, authorship continuity, 
and receipt publication requirements.
2.1 Attribution. You must keep the copyright notice, this license text,
and a NOTICE file, and provide prominent attribution in user-facing docs or
about pages where reasonable.
2.2 Receipts on distribution/deployment. When you Distribute or Deploy a
Modified Work, you must include or link a Receipts file at the top level of
your package or product docs. Minimum fields:
    - Changes: summary of additions/removals/parameter or config changes.
    - Evidence: how you tested/evaluated (scripts, datasets, configs), or
      a clear statement that you did not test.
    - Versioning: version/date/commit hash, and a contact or URL.
    - Rollback: instructions or pointer for reverting to upstream or prior state.
2.3 Clarity of alterations. Do not remove upstream names from files you did
not author. Mark files you changed. Where outputs or benchmarks are shown,
state whether they are upstream or modified.
2.4 Fair use of comparison. If you publish public comparisons or critiques
based on the Work’s results, you must disclose configurations and datasets
used and link to upstream docs sufficient for others to reproduce. (This is
a condition of permission to reuse the Work’s names in such materials; it
does not restrict independent speech about unrelated topics.)

4. Prohibited Misrepresentations
You may not present Modified Work as unmodified upstream. You may not
fabricate or conceal evaluation settings when claiming the Work’s
performance or behavior. Violations terminate the license per §6.

5. Trademarks
This license does not grant rights to use names, logos, or trademarks of
the licensor or contributors, except for nominative fair use and the
disclosures permitted in §2.4.

6. Disclaimer of Warranty
THE WORK IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NON-
INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

7. Limitation of Liability
IN NO EVENT SHALL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTOR BE LIABLE FOR ANY
CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT,
OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE WORK OR THE
USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE WORK.

8. Termination and Restoration
This license terminates automatically if You violate §2 or §3. If You cure
the violation within 30 days of discovery, your license is automatically
restored from the date of cure.

9. Downstream Compatibility
You may relicense your own modifications under additional terms provided
they are consistent with §2–§3 and do not restrict recipients’ rights
granted here to the unmodified portions of the Work.

10. No Other Restrictions
You may not impose further technological or legal measures that prevent
recipients from exercising rights granted by this license.

11. Versioning
The license steward may publish new versions of this license. You may
choose any version ever published for the Work.
