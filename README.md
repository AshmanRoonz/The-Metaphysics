# The-Metaphysics
A unified framework by Ashman Roonz linking ontology, physics, ethics, and artificial intelligence through the [ICE] process (Integration, Coherence, Emergence). It explores how reality, intelligence, and morality evolve toward the infinite Î©, the asymptotic state of coherence, awareness, and emergent unity.
